# 4-Bit ALU
 
## Objective:

The objective of this project is to apply knowledge of combinational logic designs to
real world application by implementing a 4-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) into a field
programmable gate array chip which can do binary addition, bitwise AND, bitwise OR and bitwise XOR operations.
